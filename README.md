# bad-ui
the code is actually really nice, check it out.  
this was made as an alternative to imgui, nuklear, fgui that is minimal and doesn't contain bloat like these other ones do.
this works with all renders include:
- directx9
- directx11
- opengl
- vulkan
- anything that can draw a line and render text
